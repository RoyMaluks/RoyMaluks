# 👋 Hi, I'm Ntshembo Maluleke!


I’m a **Computer Science graduate** (BSc Mathematical Science: Computer Science & Statistics – University of Limpopo) passionate about **Data Analysis, SQL, Python, Reporting, and Dashboard Development**.  
I enjoy working with data — cleaning it, understanding it, and turning it into insights that help people make better decisions.

With hands-on experience in **SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, Data Cleaning, and Data Quality**, I focus on building clear and meaningful data solutions. I’m driven by continuous learning and delivering accurate, reliable results.
